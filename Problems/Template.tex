\documentclass[a4paper]{article}
% Typically the 'article' class is appropriate for assignments.
% And we print it on a4, so we include that as well.

\usepackage{a4wide}
% To decrease the margins and allow more text on a page.

\usepackage{graphicx}
\graphicspath{./Images/}
% To deal with including pictures.

\usepackage{color}
% To add color.

\usepackage{enumerate}
% To provide a little bit more functionality than with LaTeX's default
% enumerate environment.

\usepackage{array} 
% To provide a little bit more functionality than with LaTeX's default
% array environment.

\usepackage[american]{babel}
% Use this if you want to write the document in US English. It takes care of
% (usually) proper hyphenation.
% If you want to write your answers in Dutch, please replace 'american'
% by 'dutch'.
% Note that after a change it may be that the first compilation of LaTeX
% fails. That is normal and caused by the fact that in auxiliary files
% from previous runs, there may still be a \selectlanguage{american}
% around, which is invalid if 'american' is not incorporated with babel.

\usepackage{tikz}
\usetikzlibrary{bayesnet}
% For drawing Bayesian networks.

\usepackage{listings}
% For including code snippets with proper syntax highlighting and formatting.
